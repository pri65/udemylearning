## position:-> STATIC,RELATIVE,ABSOLUTE,FIXED

## STATIC :-> 
           all html elements are static by default.

## RELATIVE :->
         *  when we give any element     position:relative, then along with this we should also mention the coordinates such left, right, top, bottom.
         * if we give any change to the positioning of any element, it does not affect the other elements. they will be at their actual position.
         * Relative positioning means you are adding a margin relative to the element where it should have been.

## ABSOLUTE :-> 
         * Absolute positioning means adding a margin to its parent element
         * unless the relative positioning it does affect the html flow.
